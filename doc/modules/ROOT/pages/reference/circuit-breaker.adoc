= Circuit Breaker

For introduction, see xref:howto/circuit-breaker.adoc[How to Fail Fast on Recurring Failures].

== Description

The circuit breaker is a simple state machine:

[mermaid,circuit-breaker,svg]
----
stateDiagram-v2
    CLOSED: [CLOSED] Allow invocations and track the number of successes and failures
    OPEN: [OPEN] Fail fast, prevent all invocations
    HALF_OPEN: [HALF-OPEN] Allow some probe invocations to proceed

    [*] --> CLOSED
    CLOSED --> OPEN: Recent invocations failed too often
    OPEN --> HALF_OPEN: Configured time elapsed
    HALF_OPEN --> CLOSED: All probe invocations succeeded
    HALF_OPEN --> OPEN: Some probe invocations failed
----

The circuit breaker starts _closed_.
In this state, the circuit breaker maintains a rolling window of recent invocations.
For each invocation, the rolling window tracks whether it finished successfully or failed.

The rolling window must be full to take any state transition decision.
For example, if the rolling window has size 10, a closed circuit breaker always allows at least 10 invocations.

If the rolling window contains a number of failures higher than the configured ratio, a closed circuit breaker moves to _open_.
When the circuit breaker is open, invocations are not allowed to proceed.
Instead, the circuit breaker fails fast and throws `CircuitBreakerOpenException`.

For example, if the rolling window has size 10 and the failure rate is 0.5, it means that 5 invocations out of the most recent 10 invocations must fail for the circuit breaker to move to _open_.

After some time, an open circuit breaker moves to _half-open_ to determine whether failing fast is still appropriate.
A half-open circuit breaker allows some configured number of probe attempts to proceed.
If all of them succeed, the circuit breaker moves to _closed_ and invocations are allowed again.
If some probe invocations fail, the circuit breaker moves back to _open_ and invocations are prevented.

Successes and failures are determined from the method result.
More specifically:

. If the guarded method returns normally, it is treated as success.
. Otherwise, if the guarded method throws an exception whose type is assignable to any of the `skipOn` types (see <<skip-on,skipOn>>), it is treated as success.
. Otherwise, if the guarded method throws an exception whose type is assignable to any of the `failOn` types (see <<fail-on,failOn>>), it is treated as failure.
. Otherwise, it is treated as success.

=== Lifecycle

Circuit breaker needs to maintain some state between invocations: the number of recent successful invocations, the number of recent failed invocations, and so on.
This state is a singleton, irrespective of the lifecycle of the bean that uses the `@CircuitBreaker` annotation.

More specifically, the circuit breaker state is uniquely identified by the combination of the bean class (`java.lang.Class`) and the method object (`java.lang.reflect.Method`) representing the guarded method.

For example, if thereâ€™s a guarded method `doWork` on a bean which is `@RequestScoped`, each request will have its own instance of the bean, but all invocations of `doWork` will share the same circuit breaker state.

[[interactions]]
== Interactions with Other Strategies

See xref:howto/multiple.adoc[How to Use Multiple Strategies] for an overview of how fault tolerance strategies are nested.

If `@Fallback` is used with `@CircuitBreaker`, the fallback method or handler may be invoked if a `CircuitBreakerOpenException` is thrown, depending on the fallback configuration.

If `@Retry` is used with `@CircuitBreaker`, each retry attempt is processed by the circuit breaker as an independent invocation.
If `CircuitBreakerOpenException` is thrown, the execution may be retried, depending on how retry is configured.

[[configuration]]
== Configuration

There are 7 configuration options, corresponding to the 7 members of the `@CircuitBreaker` annotation.

=== `requestVolumeThreshold`

Type: `int`

Default: `20`

The size of the rolling window.
That is, the number of recent consecutive invocations tracked by a _closed_ circuit breaker.

=== `failureRatio`

Type: `double`

Default: `0.5`

The ratio of failures in the rolling window that causes a _closed_ circuit breaker to move to _open_.

=== `delay` + `delayUnit`

Type: `long` + `ChronoUnit`

Default: `5000 millis`, or 5 seconds

The delay after which an _open_ circuit breaker moves to _half-open_.

=== `successThreshold`

Type: `int`

Default: `1`

The number of probe invocations allowed when the circuit breaker is _half-open_.
If they all succeed, the circuit breaker moves to _closed_, otherwise it moves back to _open_.

[[fail-on]]
=== `failOn`

Type: `Class<? extends Throwable>[]`

Default: `{Throwable.class}`

Set of exception types that the circuit breaker considers failures.

[[skip-on]]
=== `skipOn`

Type: `Class<? extends Throwable>[]`

Default: `{}`

Set of exception types that the circuit breaker considers success.
This configuration takes precedence over `failOn`.

[[metrics]]
== Metrics

Circuit breaker exposes the following metrics:

[cols="1,5"]
|===
| Name | `ft.circuitbreaker.calls.total`
| Type | `Counter`
| Unit | None
| Description | The number of times the circuit breaker logic was run. This is usually once per method call, but may be more than once if the method call is retried.
| Tags
a| * `method` - the fully qualified method name
* `circuitBreakerResult` = `[success\|failure\|circuitBreakerOpen]` - the result of the method call, as considered by the circuit breaker
** `success` - the method ran and was successful
** `failure` - the method ran and failed

== Extra Features

=== Circuit Breaker Maintenance

include::partial$srye-feature.adoc[]

It is sometimes useful to see the circuit breaker status from within the application, or reset it to the initial state.
This is possible in two steps:

. Give the circuit breaker a name by annotating the guarded method with `@CircuitBreakerName`:
+
[source,java]
----
@ApplicationScoped
public class MyService {
    @CircuitBreaker
    @CircuitBreakerName("hello-cb") // <1>
    public String hello() {
        ...
    }
}
----
+
<1> The circuit breaker guarding the `MyService.hello` method is given a name `hello-cb`.
. Inject `CircuitBreakerMaintenance` and call its methods:
+
[source,java]
----
@ApplicationScoped
public class Example {
    @Inject
    CircuitBreakerMaintenance maintenance;

    public void test() {
        System.out.println("Circuit breaker state: "
            + maintenance.currentState("hello-cb")); // <1>
        maintenance.resetAll(); // <2>
    }
}
----
+
<1> Obtains current circuit breaker state.
<2> Resets all circuit breakers to the initial state.

The `CircuitBreakerMaintenance` interface provides 4 methods:

. `currentState(name)`: returns current state of given circuit breaker.
The return type `CircuitBreakerState` is an `enum` with 3 values: `CLOSED`, `OPEN`, `HALF_OPEN`.
. `onStateChange(name, callback)`: registers a callback that will be called when given circuit breaker changes state.
. `reset(name)`: resets given circuit breaker to the initial state.
. `resetAll()`: resets all circuit breakers in the application to the initial state.

See the javadoc of those methods for more information.

[[inspecting-exception-cause-chains]]
=== Inspecting Exception Cause Chains

include::partial$srye-feature.adoc[]

include::partial$non-compat.adoc[]

The `@CircuitBreaker` annotation can specify that certain exceptions should be treated as failures (`failOn`) and others as successes (`skipOn`).
The specification limits this to inspecting the actual exception that was thrown.
However, in many cases, exceptions are wrapped and the exception the user wants to decide on is only present in the cause chain.

For that reason, in the non-compatible mode, if the actual thrown exception isn't known failure or known success, {smallrye-fault-tolerance} inspects the cause chain.
To be specific, in case a `@CircuitBreaker` method throws an exception, the decision process is:

1. If the `skipOn` exceptions are not default and the exception is assignable to one of the `skipOn` exceptions, the circuit breaker treats it as a success.
2. Otherwise, if the `failOn` exceptions are not default and the exception is assignable to one of the `failOn` exceptions, the circuit breaker treats it as a failure.
3. Otherwise, if the exception is assignable to one of the `skipOn` exceptions or its cause chain contains an exception assignable to one of the `skipOn` exceptions, the circuit breaker treats it as a success.
4. Otherwise, if the exception is assignable to one of the `failOn` exceptions or its cause chain contains an exception assignable to one of the `failOn` exceptions, the circuit breaker treats it as a failure.
5. Otherwise, the exception is treated as a success.

For example:

[source,java]
----
@CircuitBreaker(requestVolumeThreshold = 10,
    skipOn = ExpectedOutcomeException.class, // <1>
    failOn = IOException.class) // <2>
public Result doSomething() {
    ...
}
----

<1> If `doSomething` throws an `ExpectedOutcomeException`, or a `WrapperException` whose cause is `ExpectedOutcomeException`, the circuit breaker treats it as a success.
<2> If `doSomething` throws an `IOException`, or a `WrapperException` whose cause is `IOException`, the circuit breaker treats it as a failure.

[source,java]
----
@CircuitBreaker(requestVolumeThreshold = 10,
    skipOn = ExpectedOutcomeException.class) // <1> <2>
public Result doSomething() {
    ...
}
----

<1> If `doSomething` throws an `ExpectedOutcomeException`, or a `WrapperException` whose cause is `ExpectedOutcomeException`, the circuit breaker treats it as a success.
<2> There's no `failOn`, so the 2nd step in the algorithm above is skipped.
This is what turns the `WrapperException` whose cause is `ExpectedOutcomeException` into a success.
