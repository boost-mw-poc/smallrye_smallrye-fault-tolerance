= How to Limit Execution Rate

include::partial$srye-feature.adoc[]

It is possible to prevent an operation from being executed too often using a _rate limit_.

== `@RateLimit`

The `@RateLimit` annotation specifies that a rate limit should be enforced for all method calls.

[source,java]
----
@ApplicationScoped
public class MyService {
    @RateLimit // <1>
    public String hello() {
        ...
    }
}
----
<1> Declares that `hello()` must not be called too often.
Since there is no configuration, the default is at most 100 calls per 1 minute.

If the method is called too often, excess attempts will fail with `RateLimitException`.

It is possible to specify the maximum allowed rate of execution (the rate limit), together with minimum spacing between invocations.
There are also several types of rate limiting to choose from.
