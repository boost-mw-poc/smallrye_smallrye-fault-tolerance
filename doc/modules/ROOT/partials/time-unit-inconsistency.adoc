NOTE: Note the naming inconsistency between `{time-value-name}` and `{time-unit-bad-name}`.
It is common for the time unit property to be named after the time value property, e.g. `{time-unit-good-name}`.
Fixing this inconsistency would be a breaking change the {microprofile-fault-tolerance} specification is not willing to make.
