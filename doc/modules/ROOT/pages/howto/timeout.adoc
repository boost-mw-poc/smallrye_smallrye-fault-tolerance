= How to Watch for Timeouts

It is possible to prevent an operation from taking too long using a _timeout_.

== `@Timeout`

The `@Timeout` annotation specifies that all calls of the method should fail if they take too long.

[source,java]
----
@ApplicationScoped
public class MyService {
    @Timeout // <1>
    public String hello() {
        ...
    }
}
----
<1> Declares that `hello()` must not take too long.
Since there is no configuration, the default is at most 1 second.

If the method call takes too long, the caller will get a `TimeoutException` instead.
